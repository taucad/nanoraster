This crate is an independent implementation of the WebP image format, written so
that the `image` crate can have a pure-Rust WebP backend for both encoding and
decoding.

## Current Status

- **Decoder:** Supports all WebP format features including both lossless and
  lossy compression, alpha channel, and animation. Both the "simple" and
  "extended" formats are handled, and it exposes methods to extract ICC, EXIF,
  and XMP chunks. Decoding speed is generally in the range of **70-100%** of the
  speed of libwebp.

- **Encoder:** Supports lossless encoding, and lossy encoding of still images
  through `EncoderParams::use_lossy`. The lossless encoder implementation is
  relatively basic which makes it very fast, but it doesn't get as good
  compression ratios as libwebp can. Nonetheless, it often produces smaller
  files than PNG, even when compared against the slowest/highest compression
  options of PNG encoders. The lossy encoder is more basic still: it predicts
  every macroblock from the DC value alone, so the files it writes are
  considerably larger than libwebp's at the same quality.

## Future possibilities

- We continue to be interested in **optimizations** and **bug fixes** and hope
  the bring the decoder closer to parity with libwebp.

- Another potential area is **animation encoding**. Much of the groundwork is in
  place for this, but it will require some additional work to implement.

- The **lossy encoder** needs intra mode selection, skip flags, and a better
  quality-to-quantizer mapping before its compression ratio is competitive. If
  you are interested in helping with this, please get in touch!

## Unsafe code

Both this crate and all of its dependencies currently contain no unsafe code.

NOTE: This isn't a guarantee that unsafe code will never be added. It may prove
necessary in the future to improve performance, but we will always strive to
minimize the use of unsafe code and ensure that it is well-tested and
documented.
