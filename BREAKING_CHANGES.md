# Breaking changes

## 0.x

The package has no compatibility commitments before its first stable release.

- WebP `quality` values below `1` encode lossy instead of being ignored. A
  request that passed an explicit `quality` under a lossless-only release now
  produces a lossy file; drop the option or pass `1` to keep lossless output.
  Lossless bytes also differ slightly from earlier releases after a vendored
  encoder update, so byte-locked WebP snapshots need re-recording.
- The `RenderImageFormat`, `RenderUpAxis` and `RenderProjection` type aliases are
  no longer exported. Name the literal unions they stood for:
  `'png' | 'webp' | 'jpeg' | 'jpg'`, `'x' | 'y' | 'z'` and
  `'perspective' | 'orthographic'`.
